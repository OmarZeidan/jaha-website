## Our Story

Since 2011, Oliva Pizza and Pasta in Jabal Al-Lweibdeh has been serving authentic Italian cuisine in the heart of Amman, Jordan. Known for its consistent quality, fresh ingredients, and family-style atmosphere, Oliva is one of the city’s first Italian kitchens rooted in both tradition and local rhythm. Over the years, it has become a trusted destination for those seeking genuine Italian cooking prepared with care.

Oliva began with a simple idea: to bring the heart of Italian cooking to Amman with warmth, honesty, and respect for the craft. Our story starts in 2011, tucked away in the neighborhood of Jabal Al-Lweibdeh, where Oliva opened its doors as one of the city’s first Italian kitchens built on both tradition and local rhythm.

The space was built around the essentials: an open kitchen and a welcoming dining room with soft light, natural materials, and a communal atmosphere. Guests could see everything happening in front of them — the tossing of pizza dough, the finishing of sauces, the simple layering of salads. Oliva invited people into the process, not just the plate.

From the beginning, the menu reflected Italian sensibilities with Jordanian
awareness: thin-crust pizzas topped with original Italian mozzarella,
handcrafted sauces made fresh every day, and salads with seasonal vegetables,
simple cheeses, and good olive oil. Every dish is generous and straightforward,
made from quality ingredients that speak for themselves.

Over time, Oliva evolved. The menu expanded and deepened, guided by the same principles. We prepare our pizza dough in-house using a slow fermentation process that gives it structure, flavor, and lightness. Our pasta dishes are built around classic recipes, with sauces and garnishes that highlight quality and balance. The salads shift with the seasons, always built around fresh produce and thoughtful combinations. Starters are simple and balanced. Desserts like tiramisu are made in-house and stay true to timeless flavors.

In October 2022, Oliva opened its second location in Shmeisani. The new space brought the same values and consistency to a district known for its retro charm, offering the same familiar experience in a refreshed setting.

The space reflects the food: modest, grounded, and designed to feel lived in. Wood, open shelving, and warm lighting create a natural flow between kitchen and dining room. The atmosphere is easy but intentional, a place where weekday lunches turn into long conversations, and family dinners feel unhurried and comforting.

Oliva remains true to what it set out to be. A place where Italian craft meets local soul. A neighborhood restaurant that does not chase trends but stays focused on what matters. Good food, made well, and shared generously.
