## Our Story

Established in 2013 in Jabal Al Lweibdeh, Rumi Café quickly became one of Amman’s most
recognizable neighborhood cafés. In 2019 it expanded to Abdoun, and in July 2025 Rumi
Deli opened just steps away from the original café, bringing artisan bread and specialty
sandwiches to the city. Known for its Mediterranean-inspired design, carefully crafted tea
and coffee, and a strong sense of community, Rumi has grown into a daily ritual for many in
Amman.

Rumi Café began in 2013 as a response to something simple yet missing in the city: a true
neighborhood café. At the time, the idea of a casual walk-in café with character and intention
was still uncommon. Rumi brought the quiet charm of sidewalk cafés to Jabal Al Lweibdeh,
offering a space that felt grounded, warm, and quietly elegant.

The vision was never about trends. It was about creating a place where people could gather
over a well-made cup of coffee or tea. A place that allowed for pause, conversation, and the
kind of presence that often gets lost in the pace of city life.

Located in one of Amman’s most vibrant artistic neighborhoods, Rumi quickly became a
local landmark. Its Mediterranean-inspired interiors, sun-drenched corners, and balanced
simplicity echoed the creative spirit of the area. The atmosphere was designed to make
people feel welcome and at ease. Over time, Rumi grew into more than a café. It became a
daily rhythm for many and a backdrop for countless shared moments.

Coffee and tea are at the heart of the Rumi experience. From Turkish coffee and cardamom
black tea to cold brew and carefully sourced herbal blends, each cup is prepared with
attention and care. Alongside our core offerings, we serve seasonal drinks inspired by
regional ingredients, whether it is a lumi iced tea in summer or a turmeric latte in winter.

Our cakes are a signature part of the café, baked in-house every day. The selection changes
often, highlighting fruits, nuts, and flavors that reflect the season. The food menu is small
and intentional, with a selection of Mediterranean and Levantine-inspired dishes. Each item
is made with quality ingredients, prepared simply, and served in a way that invites presence
and conversation.

In July 2025, we opened Rumi Deli just steps away from the original café. This space
expanded Rumi’s identity into the world of artisan baking and specialty sandwiches. The deli
is built around a central idea: bread as craft. We bake our own loaves daily using natural
fermentation and a slow process that brings depth and texture to every bite. The sandwiches
and baked goods are inspired by local flavors, like zaatar mutabbaq, sourdough manaqeesh
with local white cheese, and labneh with makdoos and olives.

Rumi remains true to what it set out to be: a place that values good ingredients, thoughtful
design, and real human connection. A café that continues to evolve while staying rooted in
the rhythm of the neighborhood.
