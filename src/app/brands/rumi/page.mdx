## Our Story

Established in 2013 in Jabal Al-Lweibdeh, Rumi Café quickly became one of Amman’s most
recognizable neighborhood cafés. In July 2025, Rumi Deli opened just steps away from the
original café, bringing artisan breads and specialty sandwiches to the city. Known for its
Mediterranean-inspired design, carefully crafted tea and coffee, and strong sense of
community, Rumi has grown into a daily ritual for many in Amman.

Rumi Café began as a response to something simple yet missing in the city. At the time, the
idea of a casual walk-in café with character and intention was still uncommon. Rumi brought
the quiet charm of sidewalk cafés to Jabal Al-Lweibdeh, offering a space that felt grounded,
warm, and quietly elegant.

Over the years, Rumi’s presence has extended beyond Jabal Al-Lweibdeh. A smaller outpost
at Darat al-Funun sits quietly among gardens and art, offering visitors a pause between
exhibitions. Another inside the Abdul Hameed Shoman Library provides readers and
researchers a calm space for tea, coffee, and reflection. Each location carries the same
atmosphere of ease and conversation that has defined Rumi from the beginning.

Rumi was never imagined as a passing moment. It was built on the idea of slowing down, of
creating a place that invites people to be present and connect. A place where a well-made cup
of tea or coffee could bring people together, allowing time for pause and conversation in the
middle of a fast-moving city.

Located in one of Amman’s most vibrant artistic neighborhoods, Rumi quickly became a local
landmark. Its Mediterranean-inspired interiors, sunlit corners, and balanced simplicity reflect
the creative spirit of the area. The atmosphere was designed to make people feel welcome and
at ease. Over time, Rumi became part of the city’s daily rhythm and a backdrop for countless
shared moments.

Coffee and tea are at the heart of the Rumi experience. From Turkish coffee and cardamom
black tea to cold brew and carefully sourced herbal blends, each cup is prepared with
attention and care. Alongside our core offerings, we serve seasonal drinks inspired by
regional ingredients, whether it is a lumi iced tea in summer or a turmeric latte in winter.

Our cakes are a signature part of the café, baked in-house every day. The selection changes
often, highlighting fruits, nuts, and flavors that reflect the season. The food menu is small
and intentional, with Mediterranean and Levantine-inspired dishes. Each item is made with
quality ingredients, prepared simply, and served in a way that invites presence and
conversation.

In July 2025, we opened Rumi Deli just steps away from the original café. This space expanded
Rumi’s identity into the world of artisan baking and specialty sandwiches. The deli is built
around a simple idea: bread as craft. We bake our own loaves daily using natural fermentation
and a slow process that brings depth and texture to every bite. The sandwiches and baked
goods are inspired by local flavors such as zaatar mutabbaq, sourdough manaqeesh with local
white cheese, and labneh with makdoos and olives.

Rumi remains true to what it set out to be. A place that values good ingredients, thoughtful
design, and real human connection. A café that continues to evolve while staying rooted in the
rhythm of the neighborhood.
